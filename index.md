I am the founder and CTO of [SensorUp](https://www.sensorup.com/), and the Rogers Internet of Things Research Chair Professor at the the University of Calgary.

My mission is to build a world-wide sensor web to automate operational efficiency, environmental protection, and worker safety.

I lead the development of several international standards through the [Open Geospatial Consortium](https://ogc.org/) (OGC) and the United Nationsâ€™ [ITU-T](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/Pages/default.aspx). These standards are widely adopted by sensor networks worldwide to share and integrate observational data and device taskings.

I currently chair or co-chair the OGC working groups for the [SensorThings API](https://www.ogc.org/standards/sensorthings/), the [Emission Event Modeling Language](https://github.com/opengeospatial/EmissionML) (EmissionML), and the [CDB](https://www.ogc.org/standards/cdb/).

Currently, my company and [research team](https://geosensorweblab.github.io/) are dedicated to reducing emissions through sensor webs, agentic AI, and geospatial technologies.

I also mentor startup companies through Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) [Rockies](https://creativedestructionlab.com/mentors/steve-liang/) and [Texas](https://creativedestructionlab.com/locations/texas/).
